# Employee Database System (C++)

A console-based employee management system built in C++ that supports adding, displaying, deleting, indexing, searching, and querying employee records stored in a binary file.

## Features

- Add new employee records with auto-generated IDs and SSN validation  
- Display all active employee records  
- Logical deletion (soft delete) of employees  
- Index records by salary, age, last name, or SSN with sorting  
- Search employees by SSN using efficient binary search  
- Execute simple SQL-like queries (SELECT with optional WHERE clause)  

## Technologies Used

- C++ (Standard Library)  
- Binary file handling for persistent storage  
- Data structures: vector, queue, sorting algorithms (merge sort)  

## Usage

1. Compile all source files (`main.cpp`, `employee.cpp`, `employee.h`) using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).  
2. Run the compiled executable.  
3. Use the console menu to interact with the employee database system.
